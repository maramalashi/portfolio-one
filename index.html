            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Maram Alashi and I was born on May 8, 2007, to two Palestinian parents in the United Arab Emirates. 
                When I was 6 years old, my family moved to Evansville, Indiana, hoping for stability and security. I have been in Evansville 
                since 2013, and I have grown to call it my home. I have always enjoyed learning about technology, and my family says that I’m the tech-savvy child. NextTech’s 
                Catapult program has provided me with invaluable experience and knowledge that has helped me dip my toe in the tech world. With my background now, 
                I can make a more sound decision about what I would like to pursue in the future. I hope to find something that encapsulates my love for technology, creativity, 
                attention to detail, and hope to help others with my work.
